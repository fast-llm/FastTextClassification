## Latest News

- 2023/03/23: FastTextClassification V0.0.1 is officially open source, version features:
	- Support bilingual text classification in Chinese and English
	- Support multiple text classification models: traditional machine learning shallow model, deep learning model and transformers class model
	- Support multi-label text classification
	- Support multiple embedding methods: inner/outer/random



## Steps for usage

1. Clone this project

`git clone https://github.com/fast-llm/FastTextClassification.git`

2. Dataset download and preprocessing

I will add another automation script when I have time, please handle it by yourself or refer to preprocessing.py for the time being.

It is best to put the data in the data directory, such as data/dbpedia, and then divide it into 3 subdirectories. Input stores the original data set (the data set you downloaded), and data stores the preprocessed formatted data set (text-label format), saved_dict stores the training results (model and log, etc.).

3. Run the example

The tested development environment is as follows, for reference only, almost all environments should be able to run.

- python: 3.6/3.7
- torch: 1.6.0
- transformers: 4.18.0
- torchtext: 0.7.0
- scikit-learn: 0.24.2
-tensorboardX:2.6
-nltk:3.6.7
- numpy: 1.18.5
- pandas: 1.1.5



Select the module to run according to your own needs, see the next section for details.

`python run.py`

## Run the example

1. Run the DNN/transformers class model for text classification

`python run.py`

2. Run the traditional shallow machine learning model for text classification

`python run_shallow.py`

3. Run the DNN/transformers class model to do multi-label text classification

`python run_multi_label.py`



The following table is the reference result of running the demo directly:

Operating environment: python3.6 + T4

## Result display: to be continued

The author provides detailed experimental results from shallow to deep to multi-label for your reference. However, due to limited time and computing power, many experiments may not be optimal, please know! Therefore, everyone is very welcome to actively contribute, supplement related experiments, codes, new models, etc., and build OpenTextClassification together.

For the time being, only part of the summary results are provided. I will add detailed experimental results and parameters when I have time. There are many, and it will take some time to sort them out.
